// Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem. A company has four
// salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5). Once a day, each
// salesperson passes in a slip for each different type of product sold. Each slip
// contains the following:
// a. The salesperson number
// b. The product number
// c. The total dollar value of that product sold that day
// Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. Assume that
// the information from all of the slips for last month is available. Write a program that
// will read all this information for last month's sales and summarize the total sales by
// salesperson by product. All totals should be stored in the two-dimensional array
// sales. After processing all the information for last month, print the results in tabular
// format with each of the columns representing a particular salesperson and each of
// the rows representing a particular product. Cross total each row to get the total
// sales of each product for last month; cross total each column to get the total sales
// by salesperson for last month. Your tabular printout should include these cross totals
// to the right of the totaled rows and to the bottom of the totaled columns.
