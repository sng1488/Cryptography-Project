// (Cryptography) A company wants to transmit data over the telephone, but is
// concerned that its phones could be tapped. All of the data are transmitted as fourdigit
// integers. The company has asked you to write a program that encrypts the data
// so that it can be transmitted more securely. Your program should read a four-digit
// integer and encrypt it as follows: Replace each digit by (the sum of that digit plus 7)
// modulus 10. Then, swap the first digit with the third, swap the second digit with the
// fourth and print the encrypted integer. Write a separate program that inputs an
// encrypted fourdigit integer and decrypts it to form the original number.
