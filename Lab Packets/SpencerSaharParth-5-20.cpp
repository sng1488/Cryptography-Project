// (Pythagorean Triples) A right triangle can have sides that are all integers. A set of
// three integer values for the sides of a right triangle is called a Pythagorean triple.
// These three sides must satisfy the relationship that the sum of the squares of two of
// the sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Find all Pythagorean triples for
// side1, side2 and hypotenuse all no larger than 500. Use a triple-nested for loop that
// tries all possibilities. This is an example of brute force computing. You will learn in
// more advanced computer-science courses that there are many interesting problems
// for which there is no known algorithmic approach other than sheer brute force.
