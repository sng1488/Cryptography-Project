// A company pays its employees as managers (who receive a fixed weekly salary),
// hourly workers (who receive a fixed hourly wage for up to the first 40 hours they
// work and "time-and-a-half"1.5 times their hourly wagefor overtime hours worked),
// commission workers (who receive $250 plus 5.7 percent of their gross weekly sales),
// or pieceworkers (who receive a fixed amount of money per item for each of the
// items they produce - each pieceworker in this company works on only one type of
// item). Write a program to compute the weekly pay for each employee. You do not
// know the number of employees in advance. Each type of employee has its own pay
// code: Managers have code 1, hourly workers have code 2, commission workers have
// code 3 and pieceworkers have code 4. Use a switch to compute each employee's pay
// according to that employee's paycode. Within the switch, prompt the user (i.e., the
// payroll clerk) to enter the appropriate facts your program needs to calculate each
// employee's pay according to that employee's paycode.
